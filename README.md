# LunchBytes May 2022 - handy tools for git(s)

LunchBytes is a series of (roughly) monthly seminars/demos/discussions for the research software community at The University of Sheffield.

In this edition of LunchBytes, we’ll be getting together to show off our favourite tools that help with using git and GitHub

Think: command line tools, IDE plugins, GitHub/Lab features etc.

If you have a git tool you’d like to let others know about - get in touch with the host at d.wilby [at] sheffield.ac.uk
